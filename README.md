# SAVI 780 Boba Project
## Milestone 3/4/19

This repository is cloned from the Leaflet plug-in: Data Visualization Framework https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf
Starting with the HTML & JavaScript code in the "examples" folder, I started customizing the code for my data. 

The code I started with was a 2012 presedential election map, and there is still some election-related data and code  in this repository (though it is commented out where possible).  Some of it was kept for reference, and some of it was kept because I was unsure of which data/scripts/etc. where necessary for my own map to stay intact & functioning. 

+ Code for my milestone map:
    - [bobaMilestone.html](examples/html/bobaMilestone.html)
    - [bobaMilestone.js](examples/js/bobaMilestone.js)
    
As seen in the screenshot below, each state has a pie chart indicating which term respondants preferred. The pie charts are sized according to the # of respondants. The plug-in provided a event listener so a pop-up with the raw data  shows up when a pie chart is clicked. I am still looking into how to customize the pop-up.
