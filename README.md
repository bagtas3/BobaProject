## Milestone 3/4/19

This repository is cloned from the Leaflet plug-in: Data Visualization Framework https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf
Starting with the HTML & JavaScript code in the "examples" folder, I started customizing the code for my data. 

The code I started with was a 2012 presedential election map, and there is still some election-related data and code  in this repository. Some of it was kept for reference, and some of it was kept because I was unsure of which data/scripts/etc. where necessary for my own map to stay intact & functioning.
